You can't see both ribbons and status bar. But if you hover your mouse over those places where it should be, it will appear ;D

<h2 align=center> Instalation </h2>

## Instalation - Obsidian

*Community Tab* - Go on `Settings>Appearance>"Open Community Themes"` and Search for "Golden Book". Once finded, just apply it and *enjoy it :D*.

## Instalation - GitHub

1. **Download the file "obsidian.css** - You can "clone" this repo using git, or you can just simply press the green button "Code", and then "Download ZIP".
2. **Move the theme to the folder "(YourVaultName)/.obsidian/theme"** - When you have the theme downloaded, you need to copy it on the "theme folder", for it to appear on your Obsidian Vault.
   - _Recomendation_ - Since you downloaded it from GitHub, the name of the theme would be "obsidian" instead of "Golden Book". Feel free to change the "obsidian.css" file name to "GoldenBook.css" so you can find it easier on the Theme Manager
4. **Choose the theme on Obsidian Settings** - Once your done with the previous steps, you just need to choose the theme "GoldenBook" on your Obsidian Setting.

<h2 align=center> Plugins </h2>

> **Note** - There is no need of ***ANY*** plugin for you to use Obsidian, this is just a list of Plugins that I find useful and that are affected by this theme

- **Necessary Plugins** - Plugins that are too useful to not be used
	- *Advance Table*
	- *Editor Syntax Highlight* - PLEASE, use it. It's for your own sake, trust me on this one
	- *Language Tool Integration* - ONLY if your main language isn't English
	- *Style Settings* - Without it, you won't be able to change any `.css` setting that this theme provide
		- Actually, this is needed, in order to make the `.css` work correctly
	- *Folder Note*
- **Recommended Plugins** - Plugins that will help you a lot if you know what you are doing with your Vault and like to automate things
	- *Templater*
	- *Dataview* - Little programming experience recommended (If you don't have it, just learn it either on their [Documentation Page](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) or in the Obsidian Discord Channel. (It's not *that* difficult to use))
	- *Calendar*
	- *Kanban*
